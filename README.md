This repository is the most basic working example for the [svelte-i18n](https://github.com/kaisermann/svelte-i18n) library.

The examples are taken from the respository READMe.md, but solving the errors:

* import { i18n } from 'svelte-i18n' instead of import i18n from 'svelte-i18n'
* Many parentheris removed

Also, the App.html template shows a way to change the locale from the default one.
